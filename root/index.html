                <p>In Terraria there are three classes that weapons can be apart of<br> Melee, Summoner, Ranger and Mage.</p>
                <p>This is a graph that displays the amount of weapons belonging to each class relative to eachother</p>

                This data shows that on average projectile weapons do more damage in terraria when compared with non projectile weapons. <br>
                I would reccomend that anyone who plays or wants to play Terraria to use projectile weapons based on this data.<br>
                Aswell as this from the data it is very clear that multi target weapons do more damage per second than single target weapons.<br>
                From both of these conclusions if you wanted to maximise damage per second in Terraria, using a projectile weapon that does damage to multiple targets is highly advisable.
